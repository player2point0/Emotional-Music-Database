# Emotional-Music-Database
First year group programming project. The website allows users to search for songs based on emotions such as happy, sad, etc. Users can rate the emotions of songs. The website searches youtube and plays them using an embeded youtube player. Any new songs are added to a database along with an initial emotion rating, these song can then be searched for by emotion.

The front end is built using javascript, css and html. The backend is built in java.
